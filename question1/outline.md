# **Outline for Federated Clustering using MPI**

## **1. Problem Understanding & Requirements**
- Implement a **federated learning (FL) framework** using **MPI** in **C/C++**.
- Use **k-means clustering** (or optionally a CNN) as the ML model.
- Support **m ≥ 2 workers + 1 server**.
- Handle **non-IID data** (e.g., by applying transformations like rotations to MNIST/CIFAR-10).
- Implement **federated averaging** for model aggregation.
- Compare federated model performance against a **centralized baseline**.

---

## **2. Implementation Plan**
### **A. Setup & Data Preparation**
1. **Choose a Dataset** (MNIST or CIFAR-10).
2. **Preprocess Data** (train/test split, normalize, apply transformations for non-IID).
3. **Partition Data** across workers (each gets a unique subset with transformations).

### **B. MPI Architecture**
1. **Define MPI Roles**:
   - **Rank 0**: Server (aggregates models).
   - **Rank 1 to m**: Workers (train local models).
2. **Communication Protocol**:
   - Workers send model parameters to the server.
   - Server averages parameters and broadcasts the global model.

### **C. Federated K-Means Implementation**
1. **Local Training (Workers)**:
   - Each worker runs k-means on its local data.
   - Computes cluster centroids (model parameters).
   - Sends centroids to the server.
2. **Global Aggregation (Server)**:
   - Averages centroids from all workers.
   - Broadcasts the updated centroids back to workers.
3. **Repeat** for a fixed number of iterations or until convergence.

### **D. Centralized Baseline**
- Train k-means on the full dataset (non-partitioned, no FL).
- Compare accuracy with the federated model.

### **E. Evaluation Metrics**
- **Clustering Accuracy** (e.g., Adjusted Rand Index, Silhouette Score).
- **Convergence Behavior** (how quickly the federated model stabilizes).
- **Comparison with Centralized Model**.

---

## **3. Step-by-Step Implementation**
### **Step 1: Environment Setup**
- Install MPI (OpenMPI/MPICH).
- Choose C/C++ with MPI libraries.

### **Step 2: Data Loading & Distribution**
- Load MNIST/CIFAR-10 (use libraries like `libmnist` or custom loaders).
- Apply transformations (rotations, noise) to create non-IID data.
- Distribute data chunks to workers.

### **Step 3: MPI Federated Learning Loop**
1. **Initialization**:
   - Server initializes random centroids, broadcasts to workers.
2. **Worker Steps**:
   - Receive global centroids.
   - Run k-means locally (Lloyd’s algorithm).
   - Send updated centroids to the server.
3. **Server Steps**:
   - Collect centroids from all workers.
   - Average centroids (federated averaging).
   - Broadcast new centroids.
4. **Termination**:
   - Stop after `T` iterations or if centroids stabilize.

### **Step 4: Centralized Training**
- Run k-means on the full dataset (no MPI).
- Compare results with federated model.

### **Step 5: Performance Evaluation**
- Measure accuracy, convergence speed, and scalability.

## **4. Expected Challenges & Solutions**
| **Challenge** | **Solution** |
|--------------|-------------|
| Non-IID data skews model | Apply transformations (rotations, noise) to simulate real-world distribution. |
| MPI communication overhead | Optimize message passing (reduce frequency if possible). |
| Convergence instability | Adjust learning rate (if applicable) or increase iterations. |
| Debugging distributed code | Use logging on each worker to track model updates. |

## **5. Deliverables**
1. **C/C++ MPI Code** (server + workers).
2. **Data Preprocessing Script** (for non-IID splits).
3. **Evaluation Script** (metrics comparison).
4. **Report**:
   - Methodology (data distribution, FL strategy).
   - Results (accuracy, convergence, comparison with baseline).
   - Challenges faced & optimizations.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific part (e.g., MPI communication structure, k-means in C, or data partitioning)?
